## Description

Final Project - Movies scores and ratings can be a good reference for consumers when making movie-related decisions, but not all movies are available to consumers in one place. In this project, we plan to use Kaggle’s “Movies Dataset: Netflix, Prime Video, Disney+” and IMDb website to find the streaming platform with the best selection of highly rated movies to aid consumers in their subscription decision-making process. This will help consumers make informed choices based on content quality rather than sheer quantity. Streaming platforms may also be able to use this information to identify gaps in their offerings and provide more ‘popular’ movies.

## Data sources

Kaggle dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sanyacodes/movies-dataset-netflix-prime-video-disney
IMDb: https://www.imdb.com/search/title/?title_type=feature&release_date=2000-01-01,2021-12-31&countries=US&count=250&sort=release_date,desc

## Code structure

Using Python, we created three notebooks to complete this project. These are labeled using 00*... and 01*... to indicate the order they should be run in. The first is scraping the IMDb website, second is the import of the Kaggle dataset and the merge of the raw IMDb data and this Kaggle dataset, and the third answers all business questions along with all EDA.

## What did I learn

Our goal was to identify the streaming service that contains the highest rated, and potentially the best, movies. We found that Netflix has the most popular movies (based on our searched thresholds) and Disney+ has highest average IMDb ratings and Rotten Tomato scores.
